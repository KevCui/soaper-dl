### Example

- Search TV series or movies name and select the right one in `fzf`:

```bash
$ ./soap2day-dl.sh -n 'game of'
  [/movie_aTo3Njk2Ow.html] Game of Death
  [/movie_aToxNTUwOw.html] Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows
  [/tv_aToyMjUzOw.html] Game of Silence
> [/tv_aTo2Mjs.html] Game of Thrones
```

- If the media URI path is known, for instance, `/tv_aTo2Mjs.html` in the previous example is the path for `Game of Thrones`:

```bash
$ ./soap2day-dl.sh -p /tv_aTo2Mjs.html
...
[2.1] 1.Winter is Coming
[2.2] 2.The Kingsroad
[2.3] 3.Lord Snow
[2.4] 4.Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things
[2.5] 5.The Wolf and the Lion
[2.6] 6.A Golden Crown
[2.7] 7.You Win or You Die
[2.8] 8.The Pointy End
...
Which episode(s) to download:
```

- Download `Friends S01E01`:

```bash
$ ./soap2day-dl.sh -p /tv_aTo2OTs.html -e 1.1
[INFO] Downloading video 1.1...
```

The downloaded video will be present in the folder `~/<media_name>/`

- Support batch downloads: download `Friends S01E01` to `S01E05`:

```bash
$ ./soap2day-dl.sh -p /tv_aTo2OTs.html -e 1.1,1.2,1.3,1.4,1.5
[INFO] Downloading video 1.1...
...
[INFO] Downloading video 1.2...
...
[INFO] Downloading video 1.3...
...
[INFO] Downloading video 1.4...
...
[INFO] Downloading video 1.5...
...
```

OR using episode range:

```bash
$ ./soap2day-dl.sh -p /tv_aTo2OTs.html -e 1.1-1.5
[INFO] Downloading video 1.1...
...
[INFO] Downloading video 1.2...
...
[INFO] Downloading video 1.3...
...
[INFO] Downloading video 1.4...
...
[INFO] Downloading video 1.5...
...
```

:warning: The range option only works when the season number is the same. To download episodes in different seasons, for example: `... -e 1.1-1.5,2.2-2.8,3.1-3.5`

- Display only video link, used to pipe into `mpv` or other media player:

```bash
$ mpv "$(./soap2day-dl.sh -p /tv_aTo2Mjs.html -e 1.1 -l)"
```

OR the interactive way:

```bash
$ mpv "$(./soap2day-dl.sh -n 'game of' -l | grep 'https://')"
```

- Download subtitle only

```
./soap2day-dl.sh -n 'game of thrones' -s
```

- Customize subtitle language

```
SOAP2DAY_SUBTITLE_LANG=French ./soap2day-dl.sh -n 'game of thrones'
```

- Use external download utility instead of `curl`, for example using `aria2c`:

```
./soap2day-dl.sh -n 'game of thrones' -e 1.1 -x 'aria2c -x 16'
```
